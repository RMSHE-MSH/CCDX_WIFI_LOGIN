# CCDX WIFI LOGIN(CCDX-WIFI Quick Login Tool)

## Introduction

The CCDX WIFI LOGIN aims to offer users a more convenient way to connect and log in to the `CCDX-WIFI` network. This tool can automatically search for and connect to the `CCDX-WIFI` signal, utilizing preset usernames and passwords to send login requests. It eliminates the tedious steps of manually connecting to the network, accessing the login page, and entering account credentials. The `CCDX WIFI LOGIN` is committed to providing users with a more convenient and efficient campus network connection solution.

## Features

- **Automatic Connection**: Automatically searches for and connects to the `CCDX-WIFI` signal, saving users the trouble of manually searching for and selecting the network.
- **Auto-Login**: Achieves automatic login functionality, freeing users from the need to manually open a browser and enter their account information.
- **Memory Function**: Users only need to enter their username and password once, and the tool will remember the login credentials, making subsequent logins faster and more convenient.

## Project Origin

The `CCDX WIFI LOGIN` project originated from the `CCDX WIFI TEST` (a CCDX-WIFI account and password testing program), which is currently the most complete and functional tool developed for Changchun University's campus network. It attempts to log in using various username and password combinations in an automated manner, avoiding inefficient brute-force password attempts. Instead, it utilizes password dictionaries and scientific methods for generating usernames, especially implementing effective detection against weak passwords.
